Isolation Forest: Print Trees

import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn import tree
rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
X = 0.3 * rng.randn(100, 2)
X_train = np.r_[X + 2, X - 2]
# fit the model
clf = IsolationForest(behaviour='new', max_samples=100, random_state=rng, contamination='auto')
clf.fit(X_train)
#Trees are in clf.estimators_. Create dot file (temp.dot) with the tree structure which can be analyzed in order to understand which feature is the most important:

out_file = tree.export_graphviz(clf.estimators_[0], out_file='temp.dot')
